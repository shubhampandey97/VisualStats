“I set up CI early to automatically validate core logic and data consistency using pytest on every push and PR. This prevents regressions as new visualizations are added.”

After merging the pull request, feature branches were deleted to maintain repository hygiene.
This follows standard industry practice where short-lived branches are removed after successful CI, review, and merge, keeping the codebase clean and reducing maintenance overhead.

After setting up CI and branch protection, I refactored the app into a plugin-based architecture to support multiple visualizations without modifying core logic.
